<details>
<summary>Click to expand legacy YAML configuration</summary>

```yaml
# This is the old configuration method - NOT RECOMMENDED
# Please use Config Flow instead

sensor:
  - platform: franklin_wh
    username: "email@domain.com"
    password: !secret franklinwh_password
    id: "100xxxxxxxxxxxx"

switch:
  - platform: franklin_wh
    username: "email@domain.com"
    password: !secret franklinwh_password
    id: "100xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    switches: [1, 2, 3]
    name: "All Switches"
```
</details>

## 🔧 Services

The integration provides custom services for advanced control:

### `franklin_wh.set_operation_mode`

Set the operation mode of your FranklinWH system.

**Parameters:**
- `mode`: Operation mode (`self_use`, `backup`, `time_of_use`, `clean_backup`)

**Example:**
```yaml
service: franklin_wh.set_operation_mode
data:
  mode: self_use
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: This service requires API support that may not be available yet. It's a placeholder for future functionality.

### `franklin_wh.set_battery_reserve`

Set the minimum battery reserve percentage.

**Parameters:**
- `reserve_percent`: Minimum battery charge to maintain (0-100)

**Example:**
```yaml
service: franklin_wh.set_battery_reserve
data:
  reserve_percent: 20
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: This service requires API support that may not be available yet. It's a placeholder for future functionality.

## 🔋 Energy Dashboard Integration

All energy sensors are compatible with Home Assistant's **Energy Dashboard**:

1. Go to **Settings → Dashboards → Energy**
2. Configure your energy sources:
   - **Solar Production**: Use "Solar Energy" sensor
   - **Battery**: Use "Battery Charge" and "Battery Discharge" sensors
   - **Battery from Grid**: Use "Battery Charge from Grid" sensor (calculated)
   - **Grid**: Use "Grid Import" and "Grid Export" sensors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No entities appear after setup
1. Check **Settings → System → Logs** for errors containing `franklin_wh`
2. Verify your credentials are correct
3. Confirm your Gateway ID is correct (found in FranklinWH app)
4. Ensure FranklinWH cloud services are online

### Authentication errors
1. Try re-authenticating:
   - Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
   - Find your FranklinWH integration
   - Click **Configure** → **Re-authenticate**
2. Verify your password is correct

### Entities show as "Unavailable"
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the FranklinWH cloud service is accessible
3. Check the integration logs for API errors
4. Try reloading the integration

### Gateway Timeout Errors
If you see "Device response timed out":
1. **Verify gateway is online**: Check the FranklinWH mobile app
2. **Check Gateway ID**: Must be exact SN from app (More → Site Address → SN)
3. **FranklinWH cloud status**: Service may be temporarily down
4. **Disable local API**: If enabled, switch back to cloud polling
5. **Wait and retry**: Gateway may be rebooting or updating

### Local API Issues
The local API is **experimental** and may not work:
- Most users should use **cloud polling** (default)
- Local API requires the gateway to support local communication
- If local API times out, disable it and use cloud polling
- Local API support depends on gateway firmware version

### Diagnostics
To get detailed diagnostic information:
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Find your FranklinWH integration
3. Click the device, then click **Download Diagnostics**
4. Attach the diagnostics file when reporting issues

## 🔍 Local API Support (Experimental)

This integration includes experimental support for local API communication. Currently, the FranklinWH library primarily uses cloud polling, but local API support is being explored.

**To enable local API (when available):**
1. Enable "Use Local API" during setup
2. Enter your gateway's local IP address
3. The integration will attempt local communication with faster polling (10 seconds vs 60 seconds)

> 📝 **Note**: Local API support depends on the underlying `franklinwh` Python library and may not be fully functional yet. This is an area of active development.
